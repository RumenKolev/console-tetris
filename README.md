# console-tetris
A tetris game implementation made entirely in the windows console. 

The project ist based on Javidx9's video "Code-It-Yourself! Tetris - Programming from Scratch (Quick and Simple C++)", linked below[1]. It is however in no way a copy of his code, but rather my own implementation, created after watching the video. The idea for the project was, however, Javidx9's.
